It adds a 'recuperation' verb, which sucks up an exhausted ability card and spits out a refreshed version after some time. I THINK it prioritises the oldest cards on the board when it has to choose, but I am not sure on that.\n\nThis makes your ability cards more valuable as resources, it might also make the game a little harder and slower though.\n\n*Mod compatibility: Overwrites core game elements 'fatigue', 'concentration', 'passionexhausted'.* \n\n*Last game version tested on: 2019.2.d.1*",
