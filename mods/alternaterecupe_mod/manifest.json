It adds a 'recuperation' verb, which sucks up an exhausted ability card and spits out a refreshed version after some time. \n\nThis makes your ability cards more valuable as resources, it might also make the game a little harder and slower though. Spending 3-4 reason or passion on something is now a big investment and there now is an actual incentive to dream with exhausted health cards to refresh them. \n\n*Mod compatibility: Overwrites core game elements 'fatigue', 'concentration', 'passionexhausted'.* \n\n*Last game version tested on: 2019.2.d.1*",
