Once you have two bases setup, the Suppression Bureau will take note of your increased activity and put you under additional pressure. They will be able to launch raids on your bases, potentially arresting cultists or closing down a location for good. You better have some spare favours lying around or are ready to get rid of some detectives. If you don't want additional pressure from the Suppression Bureau then simply don't found more than one base. \n\nThe mod gives you another reason to explore more HQs, gives some of your idle cultists another thing to do and gives you more opportunity to scar your cultists, if that's your thing. \n\n*Mod compatibility: Overwrites core game elements for HQs and potential HQs, and the recipe 'suspicion'.* \n\n*Last game version tested on: 2019.2.d.1*",
