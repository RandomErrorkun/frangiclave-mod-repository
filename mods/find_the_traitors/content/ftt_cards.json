Tasks either fail or succeed depending on the following: \n- As long as one follower on a task has an aspect that matches, the task is guaranteed to be successful, unless a traitor sabotages it. \n- If no one has a fitting aspect, the task is likely to succeed, but can still fail. \n- If there is a traitor on a task, it will likely fail, but can still succeed. \n\nImportant tasks will decay to evidence if they aren't dealt with, optional tasks won't. \nYou lose the game once you have lost 3 loyal followers. Find the 3 traitors to win.",
